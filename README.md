## How can I deploy this project?

### GitHub Pages (configured)

This repo includes a GitHub Actions workflow at:

- `.github/workflows/deploy-gh-pages.yml`

It auto-deploys on every push to `main`.

Before first deploy, set these repository secrets:

- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

Also make sure Supabase Auth redirect URLs include:

- `https://a6a27-ai-studio.github.io/my-personal-showcase/auth/callback`

And in GitHub repo settings:

- **Settings → Pages → Source = GitHub Actions**

Notes:

- Vite `base` is set to `/my-personal-showcase/` for project pages.
- SPA fallback is handled by copying `dist/index.html` to `dist/404.html`.

### Lovable publish

You can still deploy via [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/projects/REPLACE_WITH_PROJECT_ID) using Share -> Publish.

## Can I connect a custom domain to my Lovable project?

Yes, you can!

To connect a domain, navigate to Project > Settings > Domains and click Connect Domain.
